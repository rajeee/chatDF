## General Principles

- **Test before commit**: Always run the full test suite after changes.
- **Small, atomic changes**: Each iteration should be one focused improvement, not a grab bag.
- **Measure impact**: Note before/after for any performance changes.
- **User-visible wins**: Prioritize changes that users can see and feel immediately.
