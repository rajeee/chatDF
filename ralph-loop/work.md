# Work Queue

Human-injected tasks. The loop checks this FIRST every iteration.
Add tasks as checkbox items. The loop will do the top unchecked one and mark it `[x]` when done.

## Tasks

<!-- Add tasks here. Example:
- [ ] Fix the bug where dark mode flickers on page load
- [ ] Make the chat input auto-resize as you type
-->
